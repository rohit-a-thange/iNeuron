    "### Answers for the Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the role of the 'else' block in a try-except statement? Provide an example scenario where it would be useful.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The 'else' block in a try-except statement is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It is useful for code that should run only if the try block succeeds without errors.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         result = 10 / 2\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         print(\"Division by zero error!\")\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         print(\"Division successful:\", result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can a try-except block be nested inside another try-except block? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Yes, a try-except block can be nested inside another try-except block. This allows for handling different exceptions at different levels of the code.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         try:\n",
    "             result = 10 / 0\n",
    "         except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "             print(\"Inner try-except: Division by zero error!\")\n",
    "     except Exception as e:\n",
    "         print(\"Outer try-except: An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How can you create a custom exception class in Python? Provide an example that demonstrates its usage.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: You can create a custom exception class by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "             self.message = message\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error message\")\n",
    "     except CustomError as e:\n",
    "         print(\"Caught custom exception:\", e.message)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are some common exceptions that are built-in to Python?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Some common built-in exceptions in Python include `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `AttributeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Logging in Python is the process of recording events, errors, and informational messages during the execution of a program. It is important in software development for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Log levels in Python logging indicate the severity of the messages being logged. Examples include:\n",
    "     - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "     - `INFO`: General information about program execution.\n",
    "     - `WARNING`: Indications of potential issues or important events.\n",
    "     - `ERROR`: Errors that prevent part of the program from functioning.\n",
    "     - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors that may cause the program to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customize the log message format using formatters?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Log formatters in Python logging define the layout of log messages. You can customize the log message format using the `Formatter` class.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "     handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "     handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n",
    "     logger.addHandler(handler)\n",
    "     logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n",
    "     logger.info(\"This is an info message\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: You can set up logging to capture messages from multiple modules or classes by configuring a root logger and using it across the application.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "     logger1 = logging.getLogger('module1')\n",
    "     logger2 = logging.getLogger('module2')\n",
    "\n",
    "     logger1.info(\"Message from module1\")\n",
    "     logger2.info(\"Message from module2\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The `print` statement is used for simple output to the console, while `logging` provides a flexible framework for recording messages with different severity levels. Logging should be used over print statements in real-world applications for better control, configurability, and persistence of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the following requirements:**\n",
    "    - **Answer**:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      import logging\n",
    "      logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', filemode='a')\n",
    "      logging.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Create a Python program that logs an error message to the console and a file named \"errors.log\" if an exception occurs during the program's execution. The error message should include the exception type and a timestamp.**\n",
    "    - **Answer**:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      import logging\n",
    "      import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', handlers=[\n",
    "          logging.FileHandler(\"errors.log\"),\n",
    "          logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "      ])\n",
    "\n",
    "      try:\n",
    "          result = 10 / 0\n",
    "      except Exception as e:\n",
    "          logging.error(f\"Exception occurred: {e}, Type: {type(e).__name__}, Timestamp: {datetime.datetime.now()}\")\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
